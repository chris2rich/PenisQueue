[![](https://img.shields.io/badge/contributions-welcome-brightgreen)](https://github.com/christallinqq/PenisQueue)

basic and easy to use queue plugin designed for anarchy and survival servers that i made, this plugin is a fork of LeeesBungeeQueue but LeeesBungeeQueue was designed more for the server 6b6t.org, so a fork of the plugin was created that is designed for everyone and has more updates and support


## features

### tablist

a much more easy to use tablist compared to the old one

### server ping information and a custom protocol

![Server ping with version](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/722198099132678148/751842799682453606/unknown.png)

### custom kick messages

for example the "You have lost connection to the server" message you see on the server 2b2t.org.

### custom server offline messages

instead of showing an error saying the server is down you can customize this message to whatever message you want.

### auth server support

auth server support for cracked (offline mode: false) servers. You can now have the authserver go first and then the
queue
